## How great is your memory? 

`I'll make a goldfish proud` - That is (unfortunately) my motto

If you don't work on a particular technology for a while (like a few hours or days), do you forget everything related to it? 
Well I do, and in the process of figuring out a best way to recall the concepts / code / patterns I have created `nura.dev`.

At Nura, I'll try to:
- [x] Explain concepts like I would do a 5 year old (**ELI5**) or to the current year Arun (too old, don't ask)
- [x] Write down small code blocks that I can re-use in general
- [x] Add some blog posts of things I learn or experiment in general 

I've done the hard part of creating this website! Now on to harder stuff - writing posts! 
###### **Psst[0]**: If you are wondering what `nura` means, its just my first name in reverse! 

###### **Psst[1]**: Did you know this website has a nice `Search` feature at the top right corner? Give it a whirl!
