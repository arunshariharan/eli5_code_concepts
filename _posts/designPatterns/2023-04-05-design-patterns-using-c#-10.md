# Design patterns
We will be covering the design patterns set forth by the Gang of Four (GoF). There are around 23 patterns divided in to 3 categories, namely
* Creational
* Structural
* Behavioral

In this post, we will look at each of these patterns to understand what they are, when to use them, pros and cons along with real coding examples using C#10.

## Creational patterns

These patterns help make the **system independent of how its objects are being created, composed or structured**. The following are the 5 creational patterns

* [Singleton](/posts/Singleton/#singleton)
* Factory
* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Prototype

## Structural patterns

These patterns concerns with **how classes and objects are composed to form large complex structures**. Think about *inheritance and composition*. There are 7 structural patterns

* Adapter
* Composite
* Proxy
* Flyweight
* Facade
* Bridge
* Decorator

## Behavioral patterns

These patterns deal with the **control-flow of the project** which could be hard to navigate during the runtime. These patterns helps us **focus on the way objects are interconnected**. Think about **loose coupling, extensibility** etc. There are 11 behavioral patterns in total.

* Template method
* Mediator
* Chain of responsibility
* Observer
* Strategy
* Command 
* State
* Visitor
* Interpretor
* Iterator
* Memento
